A function named collapse_cases_with_correlation is defined.

It takes one argument args, which seems to be a dictionary or an object with keys like 'final_list', 'trans_dt', etc.

The code inside is wrapped in a try block to handle exceptions if they arise.

Extracting Arguments
python
Copy code
        final_list = args['final_list']
        trans_dt = args['trans_dt']
        mkt_filter = args['mkt_filter']
        collapse_from_cache = args['collapse_from_cache']
        final_list_file = args['final_list_file']
These lines extract individual parameters from the args dictionary:

final_list: likely a DataFrame or similar structure.

trans_dt: a date string.

mkt_filter: a list of filters used for market/vendor filtering.

collapse_from_cache: a boolean flag to determine if the final list should be read from a cached file.

final_list_file: the file path to the cached file.

Generate the Previous Day’s Date
python
Copy code
        final_list_day = (pd.to_datetime(trans_dt) - datetime.timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
Converts trans_dt to a datetime object.

Subtracts 1 day to get the previous day.

Formats it as 'YYYY-MM-DD' and stores it in final_list_day.

Read from Cache If Enabled
python
Copy code
        if collapse_from_cache:
            final_list_file = './final_list.gzip'
            final_list = pd.read_parquet(final_list_file)
If collapse_from_cache is True, it overrides the file name to final_list.gzip.

Then reads the Parquet file using pandas.read_parquet() into final_list.

Market Filter Application
python
Copy code
        if len(mkt_filter) == 1:
            final_list = final_list[final_list.ENODEB.str.startswith(mkt_filter[0])]
        else:
            final_list = final_list[(final_list.ENODEB.str.startswith(mkt_filter[0])) | (final_list.ENODEB.str.startswith(mkt_filter[1]))]
If there's only one item in mkt_filter, filter final_list where ENODEB column starts with that value.

If more than one, apply an OR condition to filter where ENODEB starts with either of the first two values.

Print Initial Case Counts
python
Copy code
        print('Initial (uncollapsed) cases counts by Vendor')
        print(final_list.groupby('VENDOR').ENODEB.count())
Logs the number of rows per VENDOR in the final_list.

Generate ‘cell id’ Column
python
Copy code
        final_list['cell id'] = np.where(final_list.VENDOR == 'Ericsson',
                                         final_list.ENODEB + '-' + final_list.CARRIERREF,
                                         final_list.ENODEB + '-' + final_list.EUTRANCELL + final_list.CARRIER)
Creates a new column cell id.

If VENDOR is 'Ericsson', concatenate ENODEB and CARRIERREF with a -.

Otherwise, concatenate ENODEB, EUTRANCELL, and CARRIER.

Fix Missing DAY Values (Special Bug Handling)
python
Copy code
        if len(final_list.DAY.unique()) > 1:
            real_day = final_list_day
            for day in final_list.DAY.unique():
                if day is not None:
                    real_day = day
            final_list['DAY'] = np.where(final_list.DAY.isna(), real_day, final_list.DAY)
        elif final_list.DAY.unique()[0] is None:
            final_list['DAY'] = np.where(final_list.DAY.isna(), final_list_day, final_list.DAY)
If there are multiple unique values in the DAY column:

Initializes real_day with final_list_day.

Iterates over the unique days, updating real_day if not None.

Fills missing (NaN) values in DAY with real_day.

If there's only one value and it is None, fills all missing DAY values with final_list_day.

In simple words:
Serialize = Convert a Python object (like a dict, list, DataFrame, etc.) into a byte stream so it can be:

Saved to a file

Sent over a network

Stored temporarily (like caching)

Deserialize = Load it back from that byte stream to get the original object.

Why use pickle?
To save your objects to disk and reload them later.

To pass complex data between processes (like in multiprocessing).

To cache intermediate results so you don’t recompute again.

Quick Example:
python
Copy code
import pickle

# Your Python object
data = {'cell1': 'a,b', 'cell2': 'c,d'}

# Save it to a file
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

# Load it later
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(f)

print(loaded_data)
Where have you seen it?
In your multiprocessing code, pickle is used behind the scenes to pass data between processes.

Let me know if you want to see how to pickle/unpickle large DataFrames or use it in Databricks or Spark!







You said:
What is wb and rb in above code??

Nice follow-up, Ruchi!

In the context of pickle, the "wb" and "rb" in open() mean:

"wb" = write binary
Used when you're writing to a file.

The b stands for binary mode (required by pickle).

You use it like this:

python
Copy code
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(my_object, f)
"rb" = read binary
Used when you're reading a pickled file.

Again, b is for binary mode.

You use it like this:

python
Copy code
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_object = pickle.load(f)
Why binary (b)?
Because pickle doesn't save human-readable text—it saves the byte stream version of your object. That's why text mode ("w" or "r") won't work.
