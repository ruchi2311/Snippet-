start = time.time()
final_list, collapsed_mains, removed_for_same_enb_carrier_high_prio = collapse_linked_cases(
    final_list, merged_linked_cases_dict, prb_obj, args)
end1 = time.time()
start records the current time.

collapse_linked_cases() is a custom function that processes the input list of PRB or interference cases (final_list) and groups or collapses them based on rules (defined in merged_linked_cases_dict and maybe prb_obj, which probably holds raw PRB data).

It returns:

final_list: updated/processed records

collapsed_mains: possibly records that were kept after collapsing

removed_for_same_enb_carrier_high_prio: possibly filtered-out records based on rules like same eNB and carrier

### Lines 141–142: Calculate and print time taken
python
Copy code
total_run_time = np.round((end1 - start)/60, 3)
print("Finished collapse linked cases function taken {:.2f} minutes".format(total_run_time))
Prints how long the collapse function took, converted from seconds to minutes.

### Lines 144–147: Add debug columns
python
Copy code
final_list['num_affected_sites'] = final_list.apply(lambda row: get_num_affected_sites(row), axis=1)
final_list['num_affected_cells'] = final_list.apply(lambda row: get_num_affected_cells(row), axis=1)
You're adding two new columns:

num_affected_sites: calculated using a custom function get_num_affected_sites(row)

num_affected_cells: similar logic for affected cells

These functions are likely defined earlier to count how many unique sites or cells are impacted by each record.

### Lines 148–152: Save final results if flag is true
python
Copy code
store_collapsed_files = True
if store_collapsed_files:
    final_list.to_parquet('./final_list_new_collapse_corr90.gzip', compression='gzip')
    collapsed_mains.to_parquet('./collapsed_mains_new_collapse_corr90.gzip', compression='gzip')
    removed_for_same_enb_carrier_high_prio.to_parquet('./removed_for_same_enb_carrier_high_prio_new_collapse_corr90.gzip', compression='gzip')
store_collapsed_files = True: sets a flag to save the results

If true, saves all three DataFrames to .parquet format (a fast, columnar storage format), compressed using GZIP.

### Line 154: Reset index after collapsing
python
Copy code
final_list.reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True)
Removes old index and resets it (often done after filtering or row-wise operations).

### Lines 155–156: Print total execution time
python
Copy code
end1 = time.time()
total_run_time = np.round((end1 - start)/60,3)
print("Total time taken: {:.2f} minutes".format(total_run_time))
Again captures the full time from beginning to now, including file saving and extra columns.

### Lines 157–159: Print shape and vendor stats
python
Copy code
print("Final cases counts by Vendor")
print(final_list.groupby('VENDOR').ENODEB.count())
print("Collapse finished final_list shape:", final_list.shape)
Prints how many cases remain grouped by VENDOR

Shows final shape (rows x columns) of the final_list

### Line 161: Return final output
python
Copy code
return final_list, collapsed_mains, removed_for_same_enb_carrier_high_prio
Returns all three DataFrames so they can be used later (e.g., for correlation or reporting).

### Lines 162–164: Error handling
python
Copy code
except Exception as e:
    ...
Catches and prints any exception with file name, line number, and the object (prb_obj) causing the issue.

### In summary, this code:
Starts a timer.

Runs a collapse function to group or remove overlapping PRB issues.

Adds helpful debug columns.

Saves cleaned-up results to compressed files.

Reports total time and basic stats.
